                <h1>The Usual Suspects</h1>
                <h3>Plots we love to shoehorn into a project.</h3>
                <p>A lot of learning to be a data scientist is feeling comfortable with your meat and potatoes approach which kicks the shit of someone else's overparametized and hideously contorted ML approach. But before that confidence comes a lot of funky and cool plots. Some times these make sense to use. Some other times, while, we're all young once.</p>

                <p>Our sample frame had 281 plots. We were assured we had benchmark references for all 281. As you can see that clearly wasn't the case. With a bit of unsupervised clustering, feature engineering, critical thinking, and some tough decisions and assumptions we perservered.</p>

                <p>  Part of the Masters. A comparision of graphs generated using three different lines of data. I loathe igraph and the other packages folks use in R, so I had to create a pretty extensize wrapper around them for visualiations.

                <p>Somebody used some old classifier, developed by a pretty huge team over a few years, and I inherited an absolute mess. In less than a week we generated the training and test data, fit a random forest classifier using high resolution aerial imagery from four channels, and predicted our model onto a few tens of millions of grid cells. And of course we absolutely smoked the old product in the process.</p>
