                <p>The right tool for the job is usually the simplest one. Most problems can be resolved with a solid understanding of the issue at hand, the right framing, and fundamental statistics. These approaches are the the pillars of data science, which to me is using large opporunistically collected data sets to create value for stakeholders, and these pillars should be allowed to shine bright without gaudy flourish which would be more apt covering up blemishes. </p>

                <p> BACKGROUND: Scientists are attempting to better understand what plants insect pollinators rely on for food. Detailing this would require considerable amounts of field work and be quite expensive. Using pollen collected from an insects body, with molecular techniques, scientists can determine which plants it visited. However, the current molecular markers are not sufficiently detailed to work in groups of plants where species have minimal molecular divergence, and further filtering tools are required. For my masters I developed tools to filter plants in both space and time. 
                
                We wanted to determine whether the period over which a species of plant was flowering in an area of a few kilometers could be modelled at a daily resolution. If the plant was not flowering during this period, an insect could not visit it, and the DNA evidence must come from another closely related species. To model the flowering periods of plant species we used the weibull distribution, because we did not have enough data for machine learning. As you can see from our correlations on unused test data and the results from our training data the application this method is quite robust. 
                
                Our audience for this figure included many persons who had commonly criticized the application of the Weibull distribution for modelling phenological events. I had seem most of these people present, and I knew exactly what kind of aesthetics they liked, what they challenged about the use of the distribution, and how they like reporting statistics on figures. In a sense this had an audience of a couple naysayers. </p>
