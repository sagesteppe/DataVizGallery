                <p>The target audience for this figure were outdoor recreationalists in Western Colorado; skiers, mountain bikers, and white water rafters. These people know the content well - where does the water fall? But could use a litle direction to truly see how great of a different exists between the highest alpine and the red rock deserts.</p>

                <p>A supplmemental figure made for a colleague's publication. The target audience are truly fantastic old school professors of natural history, e.g. entomology, botany, environmental science etc. The map is an overview of Arcata, CA (that map with technical details not feature), with warm colourful pastels in an ode to the well loved hippie mecca.</p>

                <p>A supplemental figure for one of my publications. The audience for this figure are nerds who feel as comfortable in a tent as flashing linux onto bare metal and sequencing genomes. Rich in detail, emphasizing a faux pau amongst nerds of pie charts - which here have informative sizes.</p>
